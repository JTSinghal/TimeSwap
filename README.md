# TimeSwap

###### Project made by our team for the Hello World Hackathon, September 16-17.
Aim of the project was to create a Chrome Extension in order to scan a webpage for times and timezones (e.g. 8 pm EST) and convert the original times into whatever time zone the user is currently in.

Example of application of this extension: A user in England is scrolling through the SpaceX subreddit and wants the time of rocket launch. Instead of having to calculate the local time at which the launch would occur, the user could simply use the extension and receive the time pre-formatted in the webpage.

Currently unfinished.
